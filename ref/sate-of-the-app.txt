Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a breakdown of the server-side and client-side logic in your UltiUI application:
Server-Side Logic
API Endpoints (src/main.py):
The server provides multiple REST API endpoints that fetch data from the Ultimaker printer
Key endpoints include:
/api/printer-stats: Gets printer status information
/api/print-job: Gets current print job details
/api/print-cores: Gets print core information
/api/system-log: Gets system logs
/api/flow-data/{samples}: Gets temperature and flow data
/api/material-remaining: Gets material remaining information
/api/toolhead-calibration: Gets toolhead calibration data
/api/probing-report: Gets bed leveling data
/api/tolerance-threshold: Gets/sets tolerance threshold for bed leveling
Data Processing (src/log_manager.py):
Processes and structures log data from the printer
Deduplicates similar log messages
Categorizes messages by type (info, warning, error)
Maintains a buffer of recent logs
Complex Calculations:
Bed leveling analysis (calculating statistics, determining if bed is level)
Flow data processing (calculating statistics for temperature and flow)
Print core data extraction from logs
Configuration Management:
Manages printer IP configuration
Manages tolerance threshold settings
Client-Side Logic
UI Rendering:
Renders the dashboard UI using HTML and Tailwind CSS
Implements dark/light mode theming
Data Fetching and Updates:
Makes API calls to the server endpoints
Updates UI elements with received data
Implements polling for real-time updates
Visualization:
Renders charts for temperature and flow data using Chart.js
Visualizes bed leveling data
User Interactions:
Handles user inputs (e.g., tolerance threshold adjustment)
Manages alerts and notifications
What Could Be Moved to Server-Side
Data Aggregation and Processing:
The client is currently doing some data processing that could be moved to the server
For example, the bed leveling visualization could be pre-processed on the server
Polling Logic:
The client is polling multiple endpoints at different intervals
This could be consolidated into a single WebSocket connection or server-sent events
Chart Data Preparation:
The client is preparing data for charts, which could be done on the server
Alert Management:
Alert logic could be moved to the server to provide consistent alerts across clients
Configuration Validation:
More robust validation of configuration changes could be implemented on the server
Recommendations for Improvement
Implement WebSockets:
Replace polling with WebSockets for real-time updates
This would reduce server load and provide more immediate updates
Server-Side Rendering:
Consider server-side rendering for initial page load
This would improve performance and SEO
API Consolidation:
Combine related endpoints to reduce the number of API calls
For example, combine printer stats, print job, and print cores into a single endpoint
Caching:
Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data
This would reduce load on the printer and improve response times
Error Handling:
Improve error handling and recovery on both client and server
Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
Authentication and Authorization:
Add authentication to protect sensitive operations
Implement role-based access control
Logging and Monitoring:
Add server-side logging and monitoring
Implement alerts for critical issues
